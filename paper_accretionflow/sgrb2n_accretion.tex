\section{Introduction}

Sgr B2 N

High-mass protoclusters

High-mass stars


\section{Observations}


\section{Results}

There are several notable features that make this accretion flow unique within our Galaxy:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Four spiral-shaped accretion filaments point toward a common central hub
    \item The accretion filaments are \emph{optically thick} in the 1 mm continuum
        along their centers
    \item There is a central hypercompact \hii region that cannot be seen at 1 mm
        or shorter wavelengths, yet some of its light leaks out in H41$\alpha$ emission.
\end{itemize}
